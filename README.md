#### Brief Description of Project - 
This is a web application system for a travel agency providing variety of services to their clients. Mainly it provides clients to reserve flights, reserve a place to stay, hire taxies or rent vehicles and add reservations and buy tickets to the most iconic and famous places in Sri Lanka. Since all these services are integrated on the website and due to the user friendliness of the website, it can save a lot of time being wasted. In addition, we also provide them with bundle packages which is more cost effective compared to making each and every reservation separately.
Also, this project contains the website content management which allows the editor to add/ modify/delete content from the website along with the CEO dashboard and the financial management which handles all the financial tasks related to the operations of the agency.
This is a fully functional system with best user interaction and user experience which attracts clients to use the web services.
